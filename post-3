<h2>What are general education courses?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>General education courses are generalized classes that colleges often require students to take in addition to their degree-related classes. They may not directly relate to a student's degree but are a requirement of graduation. These general education classes often educate students in a variety of foundational subjects and soft skills, which are personal habits or traits that influence one's work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>General education classes expand on secondary level knowledge, providing an advanced undergraduate understanding of interdisciplinary studies, such as English, mathematics, science and history. Post-secondary students are often allowed choice in the variety of classes that meet a requirement and can customize requirements to their interests. For example, they may be able to choose biology, chemistry, ecology or astronomy to meet a science requirement.</p>
